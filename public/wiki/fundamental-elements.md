## Template

#### Introduction

-   A Template appears as a **component on the visual panel**, allowing you to **drag and connect** it to establish relationships. You can open the **edit panel** from either the editor or the visual panel to modify the component content.

#### Edit Panel

-   The edit panel allows you to **edit component content** and **manage relationships**, including adding or removing relationships, viewing which components are connected to or from the current component, and even switching to the edit panel of related components.

#### Basic Operations

-   Type **"/"** in the editor to open the command menu, select the appropriate Template, and press Enter to create a new Template.

## Relation

#### Introduction

-   A Relation indicates an **association between two components**. Connecting component A to component B means that **changes in A may impact B**, requiring B to be updated. In the edit panel, you can edit the relation description to document the reason and explanation for establishing the relation.

-   When a component is affected, it will be visually indicated with a **red dot** on the visual panel to prompt updates. If updates are unnecessary or completed, you can remove the red dot in the edit panel.

#### Basic Operations

-   **Create**: Drag from the connection point of a component on the visual panel to establish a relation, or create one through the edit panel.
-   **Delete**: Click the connecting line on the visual panel and press Backspace, or delete it through the edit panel.
-   **Edit**: Edit the relation description in the edit panel.

## Topic

#### Introduction

-   A Topic is used to **group components together**. On the visual panel, you can clearly see which components belong to a given Topic. You can also use **different Topic levels** to create a clearer classification structure.

#### Important

-   Similarly, you can edit component content from the edit panel, but unlike Templates, Topics are **only for classification** and **cannot establish relationships**.

#### Basic Operations

-   The operation is the same as for Templates: type **"/"** in the editor to open the command menu, select the appropriate level, and press Enter to create a new Topic.
